## Technologies

- Apache Lucene
- Apache POI
- Picocli
- Quarkus

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./gradlew build
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `build/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar build/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/stream-23-demo-app-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/gradle-tooling.

## Provided Code

### YAML Config

Configure your application with YAML

[Related guide section...](https://quarkus.io/guides/config-reference#configuration-examples)

The Quarkus application configuration is located in `src/main/resources/application.yml`.

### Picocli Example

Hello and goodbye are civilization fundamentals. Let's not forget it with this example picocli application by changing the <code>command</code> and <code>parameters</code>.

[Related guide section...](https://quarkus.io/guides/picocli#command-line-application-with-multiple-commands)

Also for picocli applications the dev mode is supported. When running dev mode, the picocli application is executed and on press of the Enter key, is restarted.

As picocli applications will often require arguments to be passed on the commandline, this is also possible in dev mode via:
```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev --quarkus-args='Quarky'
```
